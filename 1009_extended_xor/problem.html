<h1>Extended XOR</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>XOR is an operator for binary numbers which applies an non-carry addition on
two numbers digit by digit. For example, 1010 XOR 0110 = 1100. Now we extend XOR
into m-based numbers. For example, for 5-based number, 40302 XOR 44312 = 34114.
That is, for two m-based digit x and y, x XOR y = (x + y) % m.</p>

<p>Given two m-based numbers with n digits, you can rearrange the number by
swapping any two digits in this number. After rearranging two numbers, you XOR
two numbers and get a new number.</p>

<p>For example, You can rearrange 40302 into 20034 and rearrange 44312 into 24431,
then you get 20034 XOR 24431 = 44410.</p>

<p>Please find the maximum possible number that can be obtained in the previous
step.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>

<p>Input data contains multiple test cases.</p>

<p>The first line line contains two integers n, m(1 &lt;= n, m &lt;= 10^5 , m > 1).</p>

<p>The following two line contains n integers each, separated by space. Each
integer is from 0 to m - 1, representing a digit in a number. The digits in the
line are written in the order from the most significant digits to the least
significant ones.</p>

<h2>Output</h2>

<p>Print n m-base digits. The resulting number written in the m-based
notation. Print the digits in the order from the most significant digits to the
least significant ones.</p>

<p>Note that no extra spaces should be printed at the end of line.</p>

<h2>Sample Input</h2>

<p><code>
4 7
5 4 3 2 <br />
5 6 5 4 <br />
5 5 <br />
2 4 4 1 3 <br />
1 0 1 2 4
</code></p>

<h2>Sample Output</h2>

<p><code>
6 4 2 1 <br />
4 4 4 3 2
</code></p>

<h2>Hint</h2>

<p>In first test case, rearrange the two numbers in the follow way:  </p>

<p>2 5 4 3 <br />
4 6 5 5 <br />
result is:  6 4 2 1  </p>
